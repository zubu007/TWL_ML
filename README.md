# TWL_ML
TWL lets you "Train While Labeling" a machine learning or deep learning model.

Public datasets are available which are mostly clean and labeled. However, if you want to create a dataset by labeling on your own, it can be tidious task. Here in this repo, I explain how to collect and label datasets. The repo provides a tool to label the dataset with a GUI. It begins with you selected a model architecture (also with a GUI) for your project and then start labeling your data. The training of the model will be done on the fly as you label your data in real time. This is a great tool to understand how neural networks and other machine learning model works.
